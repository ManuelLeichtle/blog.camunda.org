BPMN Diagrams are usually displayed as a twodimensional image. A top-down view of the process, that focuses on readability and is practical for day-to-day work. This blog post explores how we can display BPMN processes in a way, that is not that useful, but much more exciting.

Those of you who were at BPMCon 2017 will probably remember the interactive experience "Be A Token" where you could walk around in BPMN process in virtual reality. This blog post explores how we built the 3D rendering of bpmn processes with Javascript using [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

If you missed BPMCon or did not get the chance to play it in virtual reality, I set up an [online version](https://linkToBATOnline.com) of "Be A Token" which you can play in the browser.

# Getting a Javascript representation of the process

A [BPMN file](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/master/test/fixtures/bpmn/basic.bpmn) is an XML file containing information about all the elements, their properties and how they should be displayed. Javascript is not very good at dealing with XML directly, so before we can do anything useful with the file, we need to convert it into a format we can work with.

Fortunately, the [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) library can do that for us. Usually, the library is used to render a bpmn process. We are going to use it's methods to access the underlying logical structure of the process to create our own (3D-)rendering. We start with importing the model like described on the [bpmn-js Github page](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js):

    const BpmnViewer = require('bpmn-js');

    const xml; // my BPMN 2.0 xml
    const viewer = new BpmnViewer({ container: document.createElement('div') });

    viewer.importXML(xml, function() {
      // our rendering takes place here
    });

Now we need to access the elements and their specified position in order to create a 3D representation of them:

    const elementRegistry = viewer.get('elementRegistry');

    elementRegistry.forEach(element => {
      if(element.businessObject.$instanceOf('bpmn:Task')) {
        renderTask(element);
      } else if(element.businessObject.$instanceOf('bpmn:Gateway')) {
        renderGateway(element);
      }
      //...
    })

The elements themselves have x, y, width and height properties which gives us all the information we need to create a 3D representation.

# About 3D rendering

A three-dimensional model in the context of computer graphics consists of vertices and faces. A vertex defines a position in space and has three coordinates: x, y and z. A face is a triangle, connecting three vertices to a surface.

For example, a cube would consist of 8 vertices (one for every corner) and 12 faces (6 sides and each side can be represented by 2 triangles)*

_*In 3D modeling, a face sometimes consists of 4 or more vertices. In our scenario, we assume that every face has exactly three vertices_

The next sections describe the construction of the 3D model for different BPMN elements.

# Sequence Flows

Sequence flows are usually represented as lines with an arrow pointing from a source to a target activity. This line can contain multiple corners. In the bpmn file, this is specified by a waypoints array, which contains all points where the sequence flow line changes direction plus the start- and endpoint of the sequenceflow. A graphical representation would look like this:

!Image here!

As you can see, a sequence flow is a single line and does not specify a width. When rendering a sequence flow in 3D, in order to move "through" the sequence flow, it needs to have some width so that it can be represented as a hallway. To achieve that, the sequence flow is split into multiple straight segments which are joined at the waypoints in a separate step.

Creating a hallway for a straight segment is easy: Take the start and endpoint and move them parallel to the original line in either direction for a specified distance depending on how wide the hallway should be. The newly created vertices can be connected as two faces to form the floor of this sequence flow segment hallway:

!Image here!

Whenever a sequence flow is not a straight line, multiple instances of those hallway segments are created that need to be merged to form one continuous hallway. At the waypoint where the sequence flow changes direction, the two vertices that define the hallway do not align (1). To fix that, a new vertex which is between the two original vertices and has the same distance to the hallway center is created (2). This creates a closed continuous hallway for the sequence flow (3). The following images illustrate this process:

!3 Images here!

This algorithm creates the vertices for the floor of the sequence flow. To create walls and a ceiling, every vertex is copied and the z-Position of each copy is set to the desired height of the sequence flow hallway. You can find the Javascript implementation that maps the original waypoint array to a list of vertices [here](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT/blob/4e677bd16f882eac5a95edc42ad3cb9b5fb667c6/utils.js#L25-L86) and the construction of the final vertices and faces [here](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT/blob/1f4a480c924bc7a236d2a629c500a809c783f9a8/sequenceFlow.js).

Now that 3D representations for sequence flows are done, let's look at tasks:

# Tasks

Tasks are usually represented as rectangle with the task name written on it. An appropriate translation to 3D would be a room with the task name written on the floor. A basic room would just be a cube the player can stand inside of. However, tasks are connected to sequence flows, there has to be holes in the walls that the player can use to enter and leave a task-room. This requirement leads to a more interesting configuration of vertices and faces. This is a single wall with the position of its vertices and faces of a task in "Be A Token":

!Image!

The floor and ceiling of the task room can just re-use the vertices created by the four walls.

Note that the placement of the hole in the wall for the sequence flow is always in the same place. That means that the connection to a sequence flow also always has to be in the same place. This works well with the manhattan-layout, where only 90Â° angles are allowed. A sequence flow connecting to the corner of a task will not be rendered correctly. For "Be a Token" this is not a problem as the levels can be designed accordingly.

When the geometry of the wall is generated like described above, the hole in the wall will always be there, even when there is no sequence flow attached. In "Be a Token" this is fixed the same way you might fix a hole in the wall in your home: By hiding it with a poster. When there is no sequence flow attached, a static image is rendered there, so that the player cannot see through the hole in the wall. If you are curious how this is done, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT/blob/1f4a480c924bc7a236d2a629c500a809c783f9a8/task.js#L378).

!Image of doors!

The same mechanism can be used to implement a door: When a sequence flow is attached to a side of a task, a semi-transparent image is created and placed on top of that opening. Since a pure white image looks a bit off, the Camunda logo makes it look like trendy glass-door. To avoid implementing collission detection for doors, they open automatically when the player is near them. Since the player is already in an unusual and futuristic scenario as a token in a BPMN process, doors slide open vertically, like in a spaceship.

This looks like the door disappears in the ceiling, but actually it goes through the ceiling. If the player uses cheats to get out of bounds of the process like shown in the picture below, they can see that the door is actually still there. The implementation of the door opening and closing is done in the [collission component](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT/blob/1f4a480c924bc7a236d2a629c500a809c783f9a8/collision.js).

# Gateways and Events

Now that sequence flows and tasks are handled, there is a third type of elements that is used in "Be A Token": Gateways and Events. Events are usually round and Gateways have a diamond-shape, with sequence flows connecting to the corners. While these different shapes work well in 2D rendering where the sequence flows have a negligible width, the 3D rendering of sequence flows makes them considerably wider, making it hard to differentiate between the two shapes in 3D. Therefore the same 3D model for gateways and events is used. Different types can be distinguished by the symbol on the floor.

!Image for a Gateway vs Image of an Event!

While task rooms are large and rectangular in shape, gateways and events are much smaller. There still needs to be a connection for the sequence flows, giving the element an octagonal shape:

Like tasks, gateways and event have doors for connecting sequence flows and intransparent images covering unused sequence flow connections. You can find the source code that created the vertices faces, images on the ground, doors and door-covers [here](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT/blob/1f4a480c924bc7a236d2a629c500a809c783f9a8/gateway.js).


# The Rest

This post only covers the basics of what goes on behind the scenes of "Be A Token". There are lots of aspects that are required, like player movement, collission detection, door labels and much more. If you are interested in that, you can check out the sourcecode of "Be A Token" [here](https://github.com/SebastianStamm/BAT).
