We are happy to announce the release of Camunda Optimize version 2.1.0-alpha2.

This release marks the second alpha release of Camunda Optimize 2.1.0. It is also the last alpha release for Optimize 2.1.0 before we release it next month. The current alpha version handles authorization for users and process definitions so that only users who are authorized to access Optimize can use it and can only see the Process Definitions they are allowed to see. In addition, we added the possibility to add external reports to dashboards and added a new Progress Bar Visualization for single number reports.
